# Movie-Share-System
Hacettepe University BBM203, Assignment 2 Fall 2020.

I implemented a library MovieShare system by using linked lists. 
The system works like this:
Information about users and movies will be stored in this library system. The users will be able to check out movies from the library and will be able to return them to the library.

After compiling, need to use, dos2unix <deck_file> <commands_file> to not get an
wrong representation.
